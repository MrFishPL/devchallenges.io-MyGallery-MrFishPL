## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrFishPL/devchallenges.io-MyGallery-MrFishPL/master/img/screenshot.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  [here](https://mrfishpl.github.io/devchallenges.io-MyGallery-MrFishPL/)
- What was your experience?<br>
  A small problem was to make a grid and keep images proportions. I don't know I solved it perfectly but it works. Anyway, I like this challenge. Making it gave me a lot of fun.
- What have you learned/improved?<br>
  I've improved my grid skills.
- Your wisdom? :)
  Before starting the challenge, the grid seemed difficult, but now it is as nice as flexbox :)
